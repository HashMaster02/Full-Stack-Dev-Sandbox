# Full Stack Developer Journey
Welcome to my **Full Stack Dev Sandbox** repository. This repo serves as a paper trail for my journey to learn and improve my skills at full stack web development. Everything I build will be housed here for both me and others to see in real-time.

Note that this repo will not contain any major personal projects, but instead house scraps and small pieces of code that I build throughout my time learning.
